## Discription
    This is my discription

        This is the Horiseon website. I have edited the HTML elements to make them more semantic and easier to read/debug. 
        I have also added comments to both the HTML and CSS where apropiate, to simplify any bug searchs if needed in the futur. 

        I will also note that I was able to simplify and consolidate the CSS in order to shorten the code and allow for a cleaner and more readable format.
